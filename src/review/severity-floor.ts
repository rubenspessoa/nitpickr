// Round-aware severity floor for review findings.
//
// When the same PR has already been reviewed N times by nitpickr, the marginal
// value of low-severity findings drops sharply (we've seen 7-round nit cascades
// in dogfood). To keep the signal-to-noise ratio sane on long-iteration PRs,
// we apply a hard floor below which findings are dropped before publishing.
//
// Schedule (priorReviewRoundCount = number of *prior* completed runs):
//   0 or 1 → no floor (full output)
//   2 or 3 → drop "low"
//   ≥ 4   → drop "low" and "medium"
//
// This module is consumed by both the prompt builder (so the LLM can
// self-restrain and save tokens) and the worker (a hard server-side gate
// applied after the model returns; defense-in-depth).
