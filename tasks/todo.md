# Website Metadata + SEO Refresh

## Plan

- [x] Update homepage and imprint metadata for canonical URLs, robots directives, richer OG/Twitter tags, and `WebSite` JSON-LD.
- [x] Add crawl/discovery files for the new canonical host, including `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and custom-domain support.
- [x] Replace the share thumbnail and ship a simplified favicon/icon family plus expanded web manifest entries.
- [x] Build and verify the static site output, then document the results.

## Results

- Updated the homepage and imprint head metadata to use the canonical `https://nitpickr.rubenspessoa.dev/` host, richer Open Graph and Twitter card fields, explicit robots directives, root favicon links, and homepage `WebSite` JSON-LD.
- Tightened the homepage hero copy so the above-the-fold messaging now explicitly includes `self-hosted`, `AI code review`, and `GitHub pull requests`, while preserving the in-progress responsive navigation work.
- Added and committed root-level crawl and host files:
  - `website/robots.txt`
  - `website/sitemap.xml`
  - `website/CNAME`
- Expanded `website/site.webmanifest` for root-scope install metadata and shipped a new root icon family:
  - `favicon.svg`
  - `favicon.ico`
  - `favicon-96x96.png`
  - `apple-touch-icon.png`
  - `icon-192.png`
  - `icon-512.png`
  - `icon-maskable-512.png`
- Replaced the social preview with a new branded `1200x630` share card at `website/assets/og-preview.jpg` and kept the editable SVG source at `website/assets/og-preview.svg`.
- Verification completed:
  - `pnpm site:build`
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm typecheck`
  - local metadata validation against `dist/site` for canonical, robots, OG image, JSON-LD, and required output files

# Responsive Website Hardening

## Plan

- [x] Replace the shared website header with a semantic primary nav and mobile hamburger menu on both pages.
- [x] Update the shared stylesheet for phone and tablet breakpoints, including a clean mobile header row and tighter small-phone spacing.
- [x] Extend the shared site script with accessible mobile-nav open and close behavior while preserving reveal animations.
- [x] Rebuild the static site, verify the responsive states, and document the results.

## Results

- Updated `website/index.html` and `website/imprint/index.html` with a shared primary nav, current-page state, and an accessible hamburger toggle for phone widths.
- Updated `website/styles.css` to:
  - keep the mobile header on a single horizontal row
  - collapse the nav into a JS-enhanced dropdown at `720px` and below
  - tighten spacing and sizing again at `480px` and below
  - reduce overflow risk in shared grids and long legal links
- Extended `website/script.js` so the mobile nav:
  - opens and closes via the toggle
  - closes on `Escape`, nav-link click, and resize back above the mobile breakpoint
  - returns focus to the toggle after keyboard dismissal
- Verification completed:
  - `pnpm site:build`
  - `pnpm lint`
  - built-site contract checks against `dist/site`
  - mocked DOM execution of `dist/site/script.js` covering toggle, `Escape`, link-click, and resize-close behavior
- Attempted Safari WebDriver viewport verification, but `safaridriver --enable` required a local password prompt that could not be completed unattended from the agent session.

# PR #4 Merge + Review Sweep

## Plan

- [x] Merge the latest `main` into `codex/open-source-docs`.
- [x] Re-triage active PR comments after the merge and separate real issues from stale noise.

- Aligned default OpenAI model examples and runtime defaults to `gpt-5-mini`.
- Added the mascot asset to the README header for the public docs presentation.
- Switched licensing from PolyForm Noncommercial to Elastic License 2.0 so
  internal commercial use is allowed while hosted/managed-service competition
  remains restricted.
- Verification completed:
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm typecheck`
  - `pnpm test` (`51` files, `269` tests)

  - if OpenAI returns a 400 unsupported-temperature error, retries once without `temperature`
  - preserves existing error behavior for other failures
- Updated `tests/review/openai-review-model.test.ts`:
  - validates temperature is sent on the first request
  - validates fallback retry omits temperature and succeeds

# PR #3 Review Thread Sweep

## Plan

- [x] Triage all open PR review threads and separate code fixes from reply-only clarifications.
- [x] Implement config, optimizer, and test hardening updates from accepted findings.
- [x] Re-run lint, typecheck, and test suite before resolving threads.
- [x] Resolve addressed GitHub review threads and reply to remaining open questions.

## Results

- Updated `src/config/app-config.ts`:
  - introduced `PromptOptimizationMode` type derived from Zod schema
  - reused the derived type in bootstrap/app config interfaces
  - documented why `balanced` remains the default mode
- Updated `src/review/prompt-payload-optimizer.ts`:
  - stabilized minimum omission marker sizing so truncation logic does not grow with full input length
  - unified text truncation marker formatting through `buildOmissionMarker`
  - clarified truncation marker initialization heuristic in patch truncation
  - normalized path separators for chunk-memory relevance matching
- Updated tests:
  - `tests/config/app-config.test.ts` now explicitly covers default `balanced` and explicit `balanced` value
  - `tests/review/prompt-payload-optimizer.test.ts` now avoids brittle path indexing, verifies context compaction structure, adds Windows-path memory relevance coverage, and relaxes over-tight numeric expectations
  - `tests/worker/worker-runner.test.ts` now uses shape-safe scope/mode assertions and non-identical before/after prompt usage fixtures
- Follow-up after next nitpickr pass:
  - stabilized omission-marker reference with a named constant
  - restored newline-prefixed omission marker in `truncateTextHead`
  - replaced `replaceAll` path normalization with regex-based replacement for broader runtime compatibility
- Verification completed:
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm typecheck`

# Publish 422 Resilience (Path/Line Resolution)

## Plan

- [x] Confirm the failing class from logs and identify the publish-path failure point.
- [x] Add publisher fallback behavior for GitHub 422 inline-comment resolution failures.
- [x] Add regression tests for fallback behavior and non-fallback error handling.
- [x] Run lint, typecheck, and tests; document verification.

## Results

- Updated `src/publisher/review-publisher.ts`:
  - added targeted detection for GitHub 422 errors that indicate unresolved review comment `path`/`line`
  - added one retry path that republishes the same review body without inline comments when that specific error happens
  - kept existing behavior for all non-target errors (they still fail fast)
- Updated `tests/publisher/review-publisher.test.ts`:
  - added regression test covering fallback to summary-only publish after a 422 path/line resolution rejection
  - added regression test ensuring unrelated 422 validation errors are not swallowed
- Verification completed:
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm typecheck`
  - `pnpm test tests/publisher/review-publisher.test.ts`
  - `pnpm test` (`51` files, `254` tests)

# PR #3 Follow-up Thread Sweep

## Plan

- [x] Re-triage new unresolved nitpickr threads after the latest push.
- [x] Fix omission-marker and truncation edge-case correctness issues.
- [x] Harden 422 fallback error-shape parsing and add non-Error payload test coverage.
- [x] Re-run lint, typecheck, and full test suite.
- [x] Resolve all addressed PR threads.

## Results

- Updated `src/review/prompt-payload-optimizer.ts`:
  - minimum omission budget now includes the newline-prefixed marker shape
  - `truncateTextHead` now preserves trailing content when marker alone would exceed the target budget
  - path comparison now uses Node path utilities for normalization before matching memory scope
- Updated `src/publisher/review-publisher.ts`:
  - replaced brittle single-string checks with structured error inspection
  - supports `Error`, string, and plain-object payloads
  - parses JSON payload fragments from error messages even when trailing text follows the JSON object
  - requires purely numeric status strings before interpreting them as HTTP status codes
  - switched to a linear brace-aware JSON object scanner to avoid bounded reverse-scan misses and unbounded parse loops
  - added defensive `safeTryParseObject` calls in the scan loop so unexpected parser exceptions do not abort fallback detection
  - tightened direct/candidate return checks to explicit `!== null` semantics
  - removed redundant scanner undefined-character guard for clarity
  - restored sanitized/truncated parse diagnostics (`errorMessage`, capped to 200 chars) without logging raw payload content
  - extracted sanitizer to module scope as `sanitizeDiagnosticErrorMessage` for reuse and focused testing
- Updated `tests/publisher/review-publisher.test.ts`:
  - added regression test for non-Error `{ status: "422", errors: [...] }` throw shape to ensure fallback still triggers
  - added regression test covering non-JSON brace content before a valid JSON payload in the same error string
  - added regression test for braces inside JSON string values so string-content braces are not treated as structural boundaries
  - added focused sanitizer tests for `Error`, object input, non-ASCII filtering, truncation, and fallback behavior
- Verification completed:
  - `pnpm test tests/review/prompt-payload-optimizer.test.ts tests/publisher/review-publisher.test.ts`
  - `pnpm typecheck`
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm test` (`51` files, `255` tests)
